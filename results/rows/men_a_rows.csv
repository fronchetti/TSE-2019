Finding a task to start with,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(Barriers 6, row 14) I researched the bugs I found and did not really find any solutions, and I also did not find anything using FLOSS COACH, but I think that what's in the tool is very well detailed about what to do, the problem is often in the time spent to try again since either performing a step requires a lot of time., (Barriers 8, row 2) I begin to read some issues, and I am scared in the lack of details in some, the first one I opened already has comments in Chinese, feeding even more my fear in this world, still so little known. Within about 8 minutes I realize, that the issues will not give me the details I need, and I need to have a sense of the code structure so that the task makes sense. I feel like I'm not in the right place yet to understand the open issue in detail., (Barriers 9, row 4) The bugs that are listed as open seem to be quite complex, and I had difficulty selecting some to fetch some solution in the code. After a selection attempt, I searched in the code trying to find something, or at least where I should change to fix a bug, but I did not find much most of the time., (Barriers 10, row 9) I also spent an hour looking for feasible bugs, that is, bugs that can be solved by someone who clearly lacks the expertise to handle with a software with more than 100 thousand lines of code, without any documentation for developers.
",,,,,,,,,,"(Barriers 1, row 3) Details:  Since I logged in the FLOSS COACH, I clicked in the “How to Start” link at the top of the page, and then, I clicked in the “Find a task to start with” section. Although I did not update this diary too much, it happened a bit before this date (October/22), when I decided to keep with the junior bug, considered “easy” by the project community. Bugzilla reports this bug but I noticed that FLOSS COACH organizes the bugs and guides very well the newcomers to the project. , (Barriers 1, row 4) Anyway, I will keep with it, because other bugs must be worse, even by name they are difficult to understand., (Barriers 2, row 4) I am facing some difficulties however to integrate myself into the forum that Amarok uses to report bugs and other minor issues, I’m looking for any bugs that are tagged as a “Junior-Job”, so I can do it., (Barriers 3, row 25) That way, I was not able to try to implement the improvement that I had proposed. Thus, I was not able to submit a fix or improvement for community approval. After all, a sum of factors led to such a situation: my difficulties at the outset, just to compile the source code, discouraged me from making more of the contribution. Added to that, the difficulty of finding feasible bugs - and that did not cause trouble to the Audacity community - took longer than expected., (Barriers 4, row 5) After running the software, I used it a bit, since I did not know it. Its graphical interface is simple and seems to tend not to complicate the code very much, which is a positive sign. On the other hand, the bugs and feature requested, found on the project page, are highly complex, requiring, in general, a different operating system or prior knowledge about the process and the file formats it handles, it is difficult to find an error or a feature to be implemented that fits the time I have to devote to this activity, since there are many other homeworks from other subjects to be done in the coming weeks., (Barriers 4, row 16) The general feeling is still one of insecurity, since, despite being accustomed to the project, I still see the bugs reported and feature requests as tasks of high complexity, in addition to the time factor, hampered by other works and materials of my semester., (Barriers 6, row 14) I researched the bugs I found and did not really find any solutions, and I also did not find anything using FLOSS COACH, but I think that what's in the tool is very well detailed about what to do, the problem is often in the time spent to try again since either performing a step requires a lot of time., (Barriers 8, row 2) I begin to read some issues, and I am scared in the lack of details in some, the first one I opened already has comments in Chinese, feeding even more my fear in this world, still so little known.

, (Barriers 10, row 11) Of all the bugs marked with this tag on Empathy, only one (yes, only one!) is relatively recent, and is related to the General Gnome Documentation (https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=724408). , (Barriers 10, row 65) The fact is that the search for another interface bug turned out to be fruitless. There is simply nothing else reported on the subject. Not just about GTK +, but also something that would be doable. With that, I resigned myself. There is no more time to try anything else, nor expect to receive a response from the community.
, (Barriers 13, row 2) I installed the Audacity. I looked for bugs but I did not find them.

But the correct way is to open from inside the SW folder., (Barriers 10, row 1) Today I officially started my journey in an attempt to contribute to a open source project. For me, the idea sounds very interesting: I've been using GNU / Linux for over fifteen years and I've been in the communities of some distros, but I've never been directly involved with bug reporting, nor have I contributed with code. I always thought that I did not have the technical ability to do that.
, (Barriers 10, row 13) Anyway, I cloned Empathy's repository and started to study the code. Honestly, knowing C does not help much. You need to be familiar with the Telepathy API, as well as GObject and GTK.
, (Barriers 10, row 19) Reading documentation and examples for an hour has already helped me to understand a bit more about the structure of GNOME software. However, it is undeniable that the learning curves of these technologies (needed to work on Empathy) are not exactly smooth.
, (Barriers 11, row 36) Now I need to look for some file with the KDE extension, however, I have not found it yet and I don’t know if it was generated, I will check the tutorial again.

Each pull request should contain comments on the modifications I've made. Current question in mind: the fork concept should be applied to every issue that I will modify, or just the project as a whole is sufficient, or both? Possible answer: in the moment I send my pull request I choose a destination, destination in this case, probably my issue.

Unfortunately, he was the only mentor online., (Barriers 10, row 14) Today I joined a roommate to see if together we could get people's attention on the Empathy channel on GIMPNet. We posted IRC messages, but just like yesterday, no one answered., (Barriers 10, row 15) Is not it strange that in the channel officially endorsed by the project people ignore you? Maybe I should only use the email., (Barriers 10, row 49) For this reason, the solution that seems most logical for me would be to do a pull request on Empathy's master branch. Does it make sense? Since I have not been able to talk to anyone in the developer community, I have no idea what contribution mechanics are going on inside.
, (Barriers 10, row 50) By the way, I think if I had the option, I would probably have chosen a project with a more active community, even if the bugs were more difficult. The lack of contact with the community and the lack of support are not an obstacle to the work, but they certainly undermine the will to contribute.
",,,,,,,,"(Barriers 10, row 56) Well, I did my pull request with some explanatory comments. By the level of community participation in bugzilla, I will not create many expectations, but since the heart of the project is hosted on Github, I imagine my request will be reviewed soon. Let’s wait.
, (Barriers 10, row 58) I spent a few days focused on other works, studying for a test that will happen next week, hoping that maybe during that time there would be some news in Empathy's repository. It is now 6:30 p.m. and so far I have had no answer - neither an acceptance of the contribution nor a refusal.
, (Barriers 10, row 59) In bugzilla there was also no comment or some kind of manifestation on my fix for bug # 738448. I do not say this with regret, for having observed the dynamics of the community, I imagined that the process would take some time. I'm just posting the news and as soon as I get something new, I'll write about it again.
, (Barriers 10, row 63) I still have no answer for both my bug report # 738448 and my pull request. This time, though, I can not argue there's zero activity in the repository: there was an update two days ago (nothing big, just translation). Anyway, it was a contribution from a member of the project. Of the maintainers, there is no sign of life.

",,,,,,,"(Barriers 5, row 12) Today I just saw if there was any response from the JabRef developers, I did not change the code and received no response., (Barriers 10, row 8) I must have spent about one hour doing this. I followed the recommended steps from https://wiki.gnome.org/GnomeLove/Mentors and I tried to talk with Guillaume Desmottes using IRC, who ignored me for the time I was online on the GIMPNet #empathy channel. Maybe he was away, or maybe he didn’t want to waste time with an stranger. Unfortunately, he was the only mentor online., (Barriers 10, row 14) Today I joined a roommate to see if together we could get people's attention on the Empathy channel on GIMPNet. We posted IRC messages, but just like yesterday, no one answered., (Barriers 10, row 15) Is not it strange that in the channel officially endorsed by the project people ignore you? Maybe I should only use the email., (Barriers 10, row 16) I looked for more bugs in Gnome’s Bugzilla. As I'm not feeling the ""enthusiasm"" of the community, maybe I should ask for a bug and try to fix it. This, however, may not be a good strategy, because if the purpose of this task is to have your code accepted by the developers, the natural way would be to have the bug assigned to me by one of them. Without communication, things really become difficult., (Barriers 10, row 49) For this reason, the solution that seems most logical for me would be to do a pull request on Empathy's master branch. Does it make sense? Since I have not been able to talk to anyone in the developer community, I have no idea what contribution mechanics are going on inside.
, (Barriers 10, row 50) By the way, I think if I had the option, I would probably have chosen a project with a more active community, even if the bugs were more difficult. The lack of contact with the community and the lack of support are not an obstacle to the work, but they certainly undermine the will to contribute.
, (Barriers 10, row 56) Well, I did my pull request with some explanatory comments. By the level of community participation in bugzilla, I will not create many expectations, but since the heart of the project is hosted on Github, I imagine my request will be reviewed soon. Let’s wait.
, (Barriers 10, row 58) I spent a few days focused on other works, studying for a test that will happen next week, hoping that maybe during that time there would be some news in Empathy's repository. It is now 6:30 p.m. and so far I have had no answer - neither an acceptance of the contribution nor a refusal.
, (Barriers 10, row 59) In bugzilla there was also no comment or some kind of manifestation on my fix for bug # 738448. I do not say this with regret, for having observed the dynamics of the community, I imagined that the process would take some time. I'm just posting the news and as soon as I get something new, I'll write about it again.
, (Barriers 10, row 63) I still have no answer for both my bug report # 738448 and my pull request. This time, though, I can not argue there's zero activity in the repository: there was an update two days ago (nothing big, just translation). Anyway, it was a contribution from a member of the project. Of the maintainers, there is no sign of life. 
, (Barriers 10, row 66) In fact, he did not want the task to end in that melancholy way. And deep down, deep down, I still hoped I'd get some response, some comment, some hint that they're reading what I posted. Even if it was a cold, rude and dishonorable answer. It would be enough that I did not feel like a Robinson Crusoe.
, (Barriers 10, row 67) In the end, it may have been just bad luck. Everyone is temporarily busy and someday everything will return to normal. In any case, I will end the diary with the same convictions with which I began the work. I still believe that the idea of ​​contributing to a free software project is great.

I ran the software and even downloaded and heard two songs: Guns and Roses - November Rain, guns and Roses - Patience., (Barriers 3, row 2) Here is the diary of the first steps I took that weekend:

Search for the Audacity code repository, which is stored in an SVN repository on Sourceforge. I used git-svn to download it, and I tried to run the configuration (./configure) and compile (make) commands to generate the project and see the binary. However, the first compilation did not run., (Barriers 3, row 4) I installed the extra packages in Ubuntu 14.04 (for the wx-config dependency, required to run ./configure): libwxgtk2.8-dev and libwxgtk2.8-dbg. The program is required to fetch flags and libraries to be used in compiling C / C ++ projects. I tried to compile again, but it continues with errors., (Barriers 3, row 8) I repeated the previous steps to the installation, following some tips / tutorials suggested by one of my colleagues who are also in this project. Once again, the compilation was not successful: Audacity returns an error when I try to run the configure script (which checks the dependencies required to run the Makefile). The problem is in the 'wxWidgets' library, but I do not understand the error it is returning., (Barriers 3, row 11) Finally I managed to compile Audacity. I downloaded the source code again, but this time directly from the SVN repositories (using 'git svn'). Then I uninstalled and reinstalled the wxWidget libraries (in their latest version). I tried to run 'configure', but it returned an error with the graphical library. Looking for a little bit, I was able to find it in the Audacity forum itself (http://forum.audacityteam.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=66766)., (Barriers 4, row 3) Like the organization of the information that specifies the collaboration, I noticed one detail that I consider negative: there is no quick and explicit indicator of how to run the JabRef code. There is even a README in the root directory to the code directory, but it also lacks instructions., (Barriers 4, row 9) After cloning the repository from SourceForge, I found the github page (https://github.com/JabRef/jabref) and created a fork for my account. Although the code downloaded by sourceforge compiled in the first execution of the ""ant build"" command, the same did not occur with the github repository. This brought a strong sense of frustration, which was only relieved after performing the tasks described in step., (Barriers 4, row 12) 	Browsing the jabref directories and commits on GitHub, I found this Igor (advisor) commit (https://github.com/JabRef/jabref/commit/3568be063f30d30d359101758c84b5041d1d2e5d), with instructions for configuring the development environment. I was happy when I found this document, because I had some doubts about which IDE I should use and how to load, modify and test the JanRef code. However, I had problems installing gradle, which caused broken packages and no dependencies even after executing the ""sudo apt-get clean all"", ""sudo apt-get upgrade"" and ""sudo apt-get update"" commands., (Barriers 5, row 2) I downloaded the trunk source code on GitHub, but I could not configure it. Apparently Eclipse did not recognize it.

I don’t know if I can commit in the trunk or if I should commit in another branch., (Barriers 5, row 3) I tried to run the project via terminal (around 22:30 PM), but it was too late and I gave up quickly, because I was tired. I got a lot of this installation and I did not get much, tomorrow I will try harder. Again I did not find where I should commit this code., (Barriers 6, row 6) The steps mentioned above about the video tutorial that describes how to download the source code, and the execution of the build and the make, did not work. The reason is that the repository where the code is is very slow, which caused an error in the download, I will download it again., (Barriers 6, row 10) The make has caused an error, which I suspect is the lack of space in the HD, at this moment I'm copying it to another directory, and I'll try to run make again to see if that was the problem., (Barriers 6, row 12) Well, I tried to fix the problem of lack of space by switching to another HD partition, and when I copied it, it gave an error, because the directory was different, so I went there and changed the directory to what it is at the moment and gave a error in the make file that I can not understand or even find a solution., (Barriers 7, row 6) Error while running autogen.sh
“checking for bogus pkg-config... configure: error: yes, from unknown origin. This *will* break the build. Please remove or hide /usr/local/bin/pkg-config.
Error running configure at ./autogen.sh line 258.”, (Barriers 7, row 10) Surprisingly, I received a response from the community about my e-mail a few hours after I sent it on Tuesday. 
After adding the ""--enable-bogus-pkg-config"" compilation flag to autogen.input and compiling LibreOffice for almost two hours, I found several errors during the tests at the end of the process. As it is reasonably late I will leave to review these errors tomorrow., (Barriers 8, row 7) As the blog I researched at the beginning of the research was succinct and with little information about the development itself, I decide to look for a new source. With just under 5 minutes of research, I find a site that teaches how to use github, I will read it at this moment. When I start to follow the tutorial present in the site mentioned, the first problem occurs, which occurred when I was trying to install the program he recommends ""sudo apt-get install git-core""., (Barriers 8, row 11) Apparently it worked, I was able to add the SSH key to my github account. Now I proceed to clone some repository to my machine. However, I find it difficult to locate the correct folder to perform such a task. After 15 minutes, I decide to create a repository on the github, add an issue in it and then try to bring it to my machine., (Barriers 8, row 22) After 1 hour trying to fix dependencies using the ""build-dep libreoffice"" command, I still have not succeeded. I will give continuity tomorrow or Sunday and try at most Monday to let my programming environment ready., (Barriers 8, row 26) Now I'm going to test if it worked by giving the next required command: ./autogen.sh. Every time it asks for some package that my machine does not have. I found several packages and I continue downloading, installing and giving the command again. I've been working for about 30 minutes., (Barriers 10, row 37) I then decided to look for a distribution that uses unstable packages. I thought Fedora would be a good choice (nothing against it). But the truth is that Fedora also gave me a hard time. My operating system is a custom Arch Linux x86_64 with many development packages already installed. Having to find all the dependencies - one by one - in Fedora was quite tiring compared to Arch.
, (Barriers 10, row 39) Finally, Fedora stopped working after some updates and did not boot up any more (some distributions never change ...). So I still do not know if what I found is a peculiarity of my machine or not. Testing using Debian from the University’s Linux Network is out of the question. Maybe by Wednesday I'll try again.
, (Barriers 11, row 5) The Netbeans repository is outdated (Version 7.0) and does not contain Git. I'll check for some updates or upgrades. If I can not use the terminal to download it, I will download it directly from the website!
, (Barriers 11, row 8) There were problems with disk space, I had to clean up some data, and the source code was not downloaded as I had thought, the download speed is very low, and whenever I need to interrupt the download, I can not start again from where I stopped, I have to install it from scratch!
, (Barriers 11, row 13) I still tried to work with Netbeans, but I did not have much success. Anyway, it was as expected after searching, but since I had downloaded the source code, I decided to try the same way.
I spent about 4 hours trying to set something up, but I did not succeed!
, (Barriers 11, row 15) I am still trying to compile but there are several errors, the first error was because I had to enter the following command on terminal: sudo apt-get install libgnome-vfsmm-2.6-dev>
, (Barriers 11, row 16) On the second try, what I am trying to fix is the Junit dependency!
Each make command takes about 40 minutes, and I've executed three makes!
, (Barriers 11, row 18) I am already facing problems with disk space, before starting these tasks, I had 9 GB free, now it is just under 1.1 GB, I don’t know if I will have enough disk space!
 It did not help, the error persisted, I will search about the problem., (Barriers 11, row 19) Well, since yesterday's strategy did not work, what I'm going to do now  is a make clean, to clean what I've compiled so far, and then redo the make, because I realized that I had executed make check instead of make.
, (Barriers 11, row 24) One more error, leaving only 200MB's of free space on the hard drive, I'm not sure what the error is, but it's something related to invalid pointer and memory map, I have to better inform myself about it, maybe it's lack of space in the hard drive!
, (Barriers 11, row 29) After 3 hours, another error occured, now it is something related to Firebird, as I said, I would try to run the make command again, but there were errors again, so I will delete everything and redo from scratch.
, (Barriers 11, row 31) After a few more hours compiling, another Firebird error occurred again,but this time I tried to search further, and I discovered that the source code was compiled, and only some test errors occurred in cppunittest. In some forums, they gave the hint of activating MALLOC_CHECK, advising to use the following command on terminal: export MALLOC_CHECK=0.
, (Barriers 12, row 2) I decided to use this tool because this tool is the one I have experience when dealing with projects hosted on GitHub. After completing the installation I configured the tool with my GitHub data, and then I downloaded the system’s source code on my computer. But when I imported the project that was cloned in my computer, I started having some difficulties because the Eclipse that I would  use was faulty, so I downloaded the NetBeans IDE, but due to lack of time I decided to keep working on Monday.
, (Barriers 12, row 3) On Monday, as the internet was not working properly in college, I had some problems to continue working, but over many attempts to use the internet, when I finally accessed the flosscoach, I found the tutorial that teaches how to prepare the workspace in my Eclipse, so I discovered the reason I was not able to run the code last Friday, since in addition to downloading the source code on GitHub, there are also still several other procedures necessary to run JabRef in the IDE., (Barriers 12, row 8) Well, unfortunately, while I was trying to understand the bug, my Eclipse decided not to collaborate and closed every time I tried to insert the message with the name that was given. For this reason, I decided to try the Intellij IDE. Luckily, the college internet cooperated and I was able to download it quickly. But at the end of the class, I did not have time to finish the build in the Intellij IDE, so I will keep it on Monday.
, (Barriers 12, row 9) Unfortunately due to problems with my Eclipse that did not open on my windows, I had to redo the entire installation process on my Linux, since it was the fastest possible solution at the moment, when I adopted this strategy, I had to reinstall all the programs on the Linux version, following all the tutorial steps again, this consumed me more than 1 hour and 20 minutes, leaving no time for the implementation of the bug mentioned in the previous report,, (Barriers 13, row 4) I am not sure if I download the source code correctly. The instructions that I found about how to compile the code are not working. I subscribed the developers lists (link found in the Audacity website)

, (Barriers 13, row 5) After endless frustrated attempts to compile the Audacity, I gave up for today.
I followed this tutorial: http://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/CompilingAudacityForBeginners.
However, when I tried to run the ./configure, it showed me an error saying that wx-config could not be found, but I already downloaded it and added it into the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
, (Barriers 13, row 6) I tried to solve the problem looking for other tutorials on Google, and also looking for other ways to add the path /usr/local/lib into the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
, (Barriers 13, row 11) But I still can not compile the Audacity. After the “configure”, when I run the make, it gives me the following error:

make[2]: ** [audacity-AudacityApp.o] Erro 1
make[2]: Saindo do diretório `/home/XXX/Documentos/engsoft/audacity-src-2.0.6/src'
make[1]: ** [all] Erro 2
make[1]: Saindo do diretório `/home/XXX/Documentos/engsoft/audacity-src-2.0.6/src'
make: ** [all-recursive] Erro 1
, (Barriers 13, row 21) I had to reinstall my Ubuntu, and now I can’t compile it again hahaha.
The error is: Audacity requires expat to be enabled.

Lack of information on how to send a contribution,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(Barriers 10, row 48) Now I must decide the best way to send this correction. I feel Bugzilla would not be the case here, since it is not a problem with the operation of the software itself, but with the installation process. I am saying it because I have never encountered an open call in Bugzilla about compilation issues.

Anyway, it was a contribution from a member of the project. Of the maintainers, there is no sign of life.

In any case, I will end the diary with the same convictions with which I began the work. I still believe that the idea of ​​contributing to a free software project is great. I still enjoy the spirit that permeates community development. And I keep using Pidgin as a chat software.

Females motivation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Females lower computer self-efficacy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(Barriers 7, row 3) Looking for “building libreoffice for mac” on Google I found a Wiki: https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/BuildingOnMac

I was already thinking of installing Ubuntu on a virtual machine so I can follow the build instructions of the floss coach links, but according to the wiki above ""The Mac is, in a way, the easiest platform to build LibreOffice on, as you do not need to get tons of stuff."" So I'll try to set up the development environment on the Mac itself."

It is the default IM application of Gnome, and is in stable version 3.14.X;
It was made to replace the Pidgin + Ekiga, since the Empathy supports both text chat and VOIP;
In my distribution (Arch), the stable version if 3.12.5, and I can not log in with my Google account or edit accounts. Besides that, I discovered that this is a bug already reported on Bugzilla.
Empathy was made based on the Telepathy framework (http://telepathy.freedesktop.org), which means that you need several Telepathy components installed on your system for Empathy to have a chance to work properly;
Empathy does not have support for encrypted messages, and it is not a fault, it is a design decision.
, (Barriers 10, row 18) Since the Empathy code is confusing for me, today I tried to figure out how GTK and GObject work. The GNOME Developer site (https://developer.gnome.org/) has cool features:

GTK: The documentation is here -> https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/
GObject: There is a complete guide here -> https://developer.gnome.org/gobject/stable/
Examples: https://developer.gnome.org/gnome-devel-demos/unstable/c.html.en
