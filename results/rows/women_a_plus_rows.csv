It was not just the “nationality” column that was not being exported to the patents, but also many others, including other types of data. Also it was not just in the .csv and .ods exportation cases that was giving a error: the .sxc format also had missing data. 
, (Barriers 4, row 28) Now there is the .csv problem. I looked at the code for a few hours, but I can not understand how the export works without having a function of its own (as the other two types have).

My colleague commented about the Logger too. In this case, is it necessary? Or just the message is enough?

The problem is that I was redirected to https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/ to understand what a pull request is and how to submit it. But I did not understood well. As I had other projects of other subjects to finish, I preferred to resort to faster help -- the help of a colleague.

Clicking, for example, in the “Find an Easy Task” option in the guide, the URL is updated to a subsection, but nothing happens.",
Documentation General,"(Barriers 1, row 2) I looked in the gnome website (as the class monitor suggested) about the Empathy project, and I found (in the bugs section) a bug that seemed simple to me (for now). I felt relieved, but I still need to understand how to proceed with the contribution in fact., (Barriers 4, row 5)      I felt a great lack of instructions on the project website itself.  The only reference about how to participate as developer was a lost question at the end of the FAQ, explaining that I should sign in the mailing list and… send an email??, (Barriers 4, row 7) If it was just to register an account, I would have done it in seconds, as I have done in a dozen of websites. Anonymity is a comfort. But having to write an email introducing me, or committing myself to help, or whatever it was supposed to write (not specified in the FAQ), curiously it seemed to me a much bigger obstacle than any technical difficulty.  It may be common to have this kind of “interaction”, and I feel that I am making a mountain out of a  molehill, but I believe that I’m not the only one in this situation, among programmers and even my colleagues., (Barriers 4, row 10)  So I went looking for the bug tracker... and it wasn’t too much difficult to find, since it was in the same question in the FAQ. But only a while later, I discovered where the feature tracker was. I don’t know if it was just my lack of habit, because I did not worked in any project like this, or if the website was really difficult to surf., (Barriers 8, row 1) Problem: Where can I find the VIM source code, which version I should use and what are the bugs and improvements that can be made? What do I need to download to start implementing something? Where do I find this information? Solution: Not solved yet. I don’t know how to solve it.

The list of reported bugs that I’m looking for bugs is: https://code.google.com/p/vim/issues/list. They are sorted by time and priority, the priority does not help much because they all have medium priority. Some of the reported bugs are not so easy to understand. In most cases, the bugs depend heavily on the operating system, VIM version and plugins used. As I own a computer with two operating systems (Linux and Windows), the bugs that I choose to try to fix are bugs reported on these two operating systems., (Barriers 8, row 36) Problem: Bugs in the “:help todo” list do not have a very large description, which makes it difficult to understand what needs to be done. Solution: I noticed that in the first list I found (https://code.google.com/p/vim/issues/list), bugs were being registered at a reasonable frequency, a lot of bugs have been added to the list since I started working on the project, so I decided to go back to that list. And I realized there were new issues. I chose a issue that was added to the list on October 29th. <ISSUE DESCRIPTION HERE>

During the application process one of the options to confirm was to send one email, I ended up assuming that it was the email they were talking about in the FAQ… But something tells me that maybe it’s just “wishful thinking” from my part, as it were.
, (Barriers 4, row 10)  So I went looking for the bug tracker... and it wasn’t too much difficult to find, since it was in the same question in the FAQ. But only a while later, I discovered where the feature tracker was. I don’t know if it was just my lack of habit, because I did not worked in any project like this, or if the website was really difficult to surf., (Barriers 4, row 12) I believe that a lot of people that do not have experience and join a new project must pass through similar moments, feeling lost or without knowing where to start to understand the project. , (Barriers 4, row 22) Now the challenge is to find out how the hell this project works… There are so many codes, classes… If at least a documentation about the code existed (not just about how to use the software), but I did not found enough information about it. I spent two hours snooping the exportation part, and so far I did not understood how it works...
, (Barriers 4, row 25) And as always I marvel at the practicality of this environment: unlike before, when I needed to spend two hours looking for where the “patent” was defined, and I did not find anything very useful, in this case I only needed a few minutes, less than half an hour, to find a lot of definitions and also my first suspect to the bug #913 cause. Definitely, it was so much easier to steer my code, although I think there still is a lack of documentation. 
, (Barriers 5, row 76) The biggest problem now is to find in the code the block related to the ordered lists. I searched at OpenGrok for related keywords, but I didn’t found useful results. When it’s time to compile, I’ll search again. If I do not find it at all, I’ll ask the community for help., (Barriers 5, row 81) The focus today is try to find the code related to the ordered lists creation, to identify and, if possible, fix the bug of the ordered lists that uses Roman numerals. I’ll search again on OpenGrok for keywords related to these lists. , (Barriers 5, row 84) I found some files related to the definition of the list patterns and the Writer module specifically, but I did not find any differences in the codes. For example, when using Arabic and Roman characters, which could justify the indentation problem in the paragraphs after the Roman numerator. The fact that several codes almost have no comments does not help much either., (Barriers 5, row 88) Something I had not thought about was consulting the help page about numbering styles, position, options. OK, it didn’t help me., (Barriers 5, row 89) I’ll create a query for “numbering type” and “formating”, not on the OpenGrok, but using the Terminal, with grep, in the Writer module. I didn’t found any useful reference that I’m looking for. The only ones that could have any relation are those the OpenGrok had already found. It’s very complicated to find something and “find myself” in these codes., (Barriers 7, row 10) After letting the code compiling over the night, when I woke up, I saw that everything has been compiled correctly. But, when I tried to execute it again today, using the following command ‘$ instdir/program/soffice --writer’, an error appeared: ‘bash: instdir/program/soffice: File or folder not found’. I don’t know what is exactly happening, I feel a bit lost., (Barriers 7, row 11) Today is Monday, and I keep with the same LibreOffice compilation problem. Even searching on Google, I don’t find a solution. Initially, the compiling process supposedly worked well, but I’m not sure, because it is taking a long time to finish. I left the notebook on and went to my bed., (Barriers 8, row 1) Problem: Where can I find the VIM source code, which version I should use and what are the bugs and improvements that can be made?

I was trying to run it on Debian Linux and some problems occurred., (Barriers 3, row 6) I kept trying to fix the bug. Due to problems in configuring the environment, I could not fix the bug in time. I realized that I should have planned my time better because unforeseen events can happen at any time., (Barriers 5, row 20) I executed the autogen and two libraries were not found. Since they were not downloaded using the build-dep, I’ll need to select them manually. I installed the remaining libraries and executed the autogen again, now, with success., (Barriers 5, row 23) Since I want workful workspace to review the codes and choose a task, this is a very slow part.

This time, a reference was not found in one of the module files. I’ll try to compile the module directly through the Makefile, to see if it will have success. I hope I don’t have to recompile the whole project, because it could take a while, since the other modules are working correctly., (Barriers 5, row 66) I started the module compilation using the Make command. The same error appeared. I tried again to pull the project, this time, without the rebase option that is indicated in the wiki, and a notification told me that there are, yes, some updates from the remote repository. Changes merged, I’ll recompile the project. Apparently, the process is more faster than the first time. I really hope it is., (Barriers 5, row 67) 90 minutes later, the compilation is still in progress. More than 4 hours and a half and the process ended, without errors. The worst thing: I received a error from the IDE.
I don’t think it’s a local change that I don’t remember, but I reseted the repository.  I am already frustrated for today, so I’ll not touch anything else at the moment. I’ll try to compile it again later.
, (Barriers 5, row 68) I was thinking about trying to reset the folder again, rewind it and delete any change, but now I’m considering simply clone the repository to waste less time because, as I am not understanding the reasons it’s presenting errors, if I try to recompile it again and it gives me errors, I’ll have more six hours of lost work., (Barriers 5, row 70) For my surprise, the download has already an error (invalid response by server: protocol error: bad line length character). I checked if the Git version is the latest and I’ll try again.
50 minutes and 40% downloaded. I was lucky with the server used, because it took just 1 hour and a half and the download already ended (without errors). I’ll start compiling the project again (a process that, probably, will only be completed tomorrow)., (Barriers 5, row 77) Compilation restarted. Now the connection is working and the process started. I’ll not be able to browse the files and review the codes while it’s compiling, the system is very slow, it starts to crash too much.
, (Barriers 5, row 87) It did not started as I expected. Two times that I opened the IDE I had to close it because it crashed and left the whole system slow. Reproducing the error did not give me ideas about how to improve the code search. I searched again for terms related to “numeration”, “numbering type”, “formatting”, “uppercase roman number”, “lowercase roman number”
, (Barriers 7, row 7) Today, after reinstalling the entire operating system (now using the latest version of Xubuntu), I reinstalled all the dependencies, and started the download of the source code. However, as people warned me, there is a long wait until the whole process is completed, I started 4 hours ago and at the moment the progress is still 51%., (Barriers 7, row 8) After a few hours, the process was finished, however, when I started the setup process, I couldn’t continue because there were dependencies that had not been installed. I installed the missing dependencies, and I resumed the compilation. During the process (around 4 AM) I realize that it is still far from over, so I leaved the notebook on, and went to sleep. , (Barriers 7, row 10) After letting the code compiling over the night, when I woke up, I saw that everything has been compiled correctly.

Next steps: Compile the LibreOffice and read a little bit more the Wiki. That’s because I’ll have the code, but I probably will not know what to do with it., (Barriers 6, row 20) In the wiki, there is a second link that teaches how to download the code using Kdevelop. I’ll try to do it later. Today I felt demotivated as the last time. But I know that I should not be discouraged! I still want the code and I need it. The little steps I’m doing will make me stronger. The next step is to try to download the code using Kdevelop. It must work!
, (Barriers 6, row 31) At this moment I’m feeling much more excited about what’s going on. I am happy because I fixed my problem, which was very simple to fix. I will never be discouraged, because the courage helped me fixing it., (Barriers 6, row 37) At the compiling moment, I am a bit lost in the tutorial. I executed the command as described in the tutorial. What appeared to me is quite different from what appeared in the tutorial. But I'm moving on. And it seems to be compiling.  And in the present moment, I am only waiting for the compilation., (Barriers 6, row 45) I accessed the LibreOffice website, I clicked on the “Developers”, available in the Community Menu. Then I clicked on “Get the code”.  Well, the information I wanted was all there. This menu explains how to download the code and how to compile it. Things are getting better: on the site, the compilation is being described the way it worked for me! Then I relaxed. Even if only for a moment., (Barriers 6, row 47) I executed the command: “make debugrun”. And now what should I do, wait? I do not know what's about to happen. I do not know if it takes time to run, I do not know if I should have opened something. Nothing happened. I changed the command and executed “instdir/program/soffice”. And instantly the LibreOffice that I know as a user opens. I’m happy. During this project, I had only been happy when I discovered how to download the code., (Barriers 6, row 48) Now, I’m feeling comfortable. I’m sure that the downloaded code is correct and everything is fine with the compiling process. I can not forget to say that I’m fully happy and satisfied with it., (Barriers 9, row 15) I get the following monitor tip: http://www.vim.org -> Download -> Development
Hopes begin to arise
, (Barriers 9, row 30) I was able to discuss with other classmates possible strategies for contributions, which would be more difficult if I chose a project that has personal or individual use. Using VIM was very useful.

In this case, I needed to understand the basics of the script language. I took some time to understand the language, and to do some tests. There was a ‘OK’ variable in the read function (function responsible for unpacking the file), that checks if the software was able to unpack the file. I tried to use the value of this same variable in the write function (function responsible for file compression). But the value of the variable is not saved from one function to another, the value is lost. So it didn’t work.

In addition to the easy hacks, the page also presents a direction to pages about ideas and features that have not been implemented yet, or that need to be improved. 
, (Barriers 5, row 40) The following section talks about the submission changes, explaining how to create a local commit or how to send a patch in the gerrit for evaluation. 
, (Barriers 5, row 41) The “easy hacks” slide talks about the idea behind the concept (easy tasks that everyone can do that has a real impact on the project), and exemplifies some types of tasks: Comments translation, removal of useless code, removal of deprecated conditions used for compilation and in related codes, SvStream operators correction. It also explains some general git commands, and how to create your own “easy hacks based on errors registered in Bugzilla.  
, (Barriers 5, row 58) The comments made on the bug page are right, according to the documentation, the descriptors of the given options should be: [M] Replace when modify existing text  e [T] AutoFormat while typing,  [M] Replace while modifying existing text  e [T] AutoFormat/AutoCorrect while typing., (Barriers 5, row 73) None of the other bugs are simple as that, because this one could be used as a test before a larger one (but, with these problems, I could not fix it anyway). I need to choose fastly one between the two available, which I prefer (Past text without formatting, and Indentation Fixing of the N-th element in ordered lists). The only thing that I can do at this moment is try to find and study the code involved in both bugs., (Barriers 5, row 82) For now, I’ve found only the names of the interface description files: NumberingRules.idl, NumberingLevel.idl and NumberingAlignment.idl. I’ll review those files. In NumberingLevel, the identifiers NumeringType and SymbolTextDistance are defined, as the identifiers of the numbering type in ordered lists and the distance between a numbering symbol and the paragraph text, respectively. 
, (Barriers 5, row 83) In NumberingType, the numbering constants are defined: ROMAN_UPPER is for  upper-case Roman numerals and ROMAN_LOWER for lower-case numbers. Now, it seems like I’am going to somewhere, it seems more interesting now. I am trying to search for ROMAN_UPPER, to see where it’s used, as well as the SymbolTextDistance and NumberingType.
, (Barriers 6, row 3)  I click on it and it opens the development wiki. I feel excited, because I found information about how to contribute in a short time., (Barriers 6, row 5) Things I learned by reading the article: 
* I can contribute as a user or as developer. I fit into the second group.
* There is a code review page and I can refer to it to find out things about the code repositories. 
, (Barriers 6, row 24) I look down and realize that there are comments from people who contributed in some way to the bug. I noticed that in addition to code or reporting a bug, I can also contribute testing. It’s great to be able to contribute in many ways., (Barriers 6, row 27) Today, I learned about the Easy Hacks, and the way they are presented. Knowledge is always important, but I still want that code! My classmates already downloaded their codes, and I do not want to be left behind. I hope I get my code by Friday., (Barriers 6, row 28) Quick report about what is going to happen now. I confirmed with a classmate the problem regarding to my Ubuntu version: my version was no longer receiving support, so all the repositories were offline. I installed a new distribution and this one I’m sure still has support. , (Barriers 6, row 45) I accessed the LibreOffice website, I clicked on the “Developers”, available in the Community Menu. Then I clicked on “Get the code”.  Well, the information I wanted was all there. This menu explains how to download the code and how to compile it. Things are getting better: on the site, the compilation is being described the way it worked for me! Then I relaxed. Even if only for a moment., (Barriers 6, row 47) I executed the command: “make debugrun”. And now what should I do, wait? I do not know what's about to happen. I do not know if it takes time to run, I do not know if I should have opened something. Nothing happened. I changed the command and executed “instdir/program/soffice”. And instantly the LibreOffice that I know as a user opens. I’m happy. During this project, I had only been happy when I discovered how to download the code., (Barriers 6, row 50) The website does not seem very informative for me. I’ll try to do some research on Google and Bugzilla (I learned how to use Bugzilla), and I’ll try to evolve. , (Barriers 7, row 1) During the lesson, I begin working in the second project of the the Capstone discipline. Initially, I navigate through the LibreOffice Portuguese page, trying to find the downloadable source code, in the community tab, I clicked on Developers option to do the download. However, I find out that for the compilation and the execution process, I need to be a Linux user., (Barriers 7, row 9) All the followed instructions were found on the official LibreOffice website, in the “Community / Developers” section, where there is a option to download the source code. In this section, there are some instructions about how to compile and run the software. I had some doubts, so I accessed the available Wiki link, and there is a video tutorial that really helped me a lot., (Barriers 7, row 14) I tried again using the command taken from the Wiki: ‘# git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core libreoffice’, this time the download started. After approximately 4 hours the download is completed, so now I’ll only follow the instructions suggested in the Wiki: using the ‘# cd libreoffice’ to access the LibreOffice folder, followed by  ‘# ./autogen.sh’, and then ‘# make’. A few more hours are needed (I started at 1:30 PM, and now it’s 03:20 PM, I have not finished yet, so I will sleep). When I woke up, around 7:30 AM, the process was still not finished, it only ended at 08:40 PM., (Barriers 7, row 15) 	Apparently everything worked well with the compilation of LibreOffice. I looked for files in the downloaded folders that could help me with the LibreOffice contribution process, especially the READ ME file. I also accessed Bugzilla. Now, I’m looking for a bug to try to fix. 
, (Barriers 8, row 11) Problem: “What needs to be modified in dosinst.c to display the VIM icon on the menu?"" Solution: Looking at the code I realized that these information is made through the “Windows Registry”. Windows Registry is a hierarchical dataset that contains the configuration settings and system options in Windows. So the problem now is to understand how the Registry works. I looked at several websites trying to understand how to change Windows records and I discovered that there are Windows functions that create new registry keys. And that there is a regedit (software) that is used to change the records manually., (Barriers 8, row 19) Since I still can not find the value of the Windows registry to display the icon on the menu, I decided to look for another bug or improvement that could be done.

Looking in this list (https://code.google.com/p/vim/issues/list ), I chose another issue: <ISSUE DESCRIPTION HERE>
, (Barriers 8, row 24) 2) Another point is that when reading the original script, all the comments and the script itself were written with the purpose of not letting VIM be installed in a folder that does not end with 'vim' in a way, in my conclusion, very intentional.
, (Barriers 8, row 25) So, since one of the purposes of this work is to have an improvement or bug fix accepted by the project, I think this issue has a small chance of being accepted, because the folder name having to end with 'vim' is something purposeful
, (Barriers 8, row 31) The E486 error message is set to ‘Pattern not found’. I searched on Google the term “E486 VIM”, and I got results that show that the error message corresponding to this errors is actually “Pattern not found”. So, in my conclusion, it is right that the error message is shown with the number E486., (Barriers 8, row 34) The bt_dontwrite(char* buf) function returns true if the buf is nowrite or nofile buffer. Buftype documentation from the website http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html:  
< DOCUMENTATION HERE>. The message seems correct,  otherwise the message would be too long and would not look like a standard VIM error message. , (Barriers 8, row 44) I searched the internet for this error and found these two sites:
http://vim.1045645.n5.nabble.com/Vim-build-error-quot-no-terminal-library-found-quot-Was-Reformatting-numbered-lists-td3876565.html
http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Building_Vim
It seems that I needed to download some dependencies before installing VIM.
In the site http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Building_Vim, I found the following command to download these dependencies: apt-get build-dep vim-gnome.
After I downloaded these dependencies the “make” worked., (Barriers 8, row 52) Problem: How to submit the changes?
Solution: In the VIM official website, there is a section about development, which is where I found the information to download the source code of VIM, and where I found the lists of bugs and improvements (http://www.vim.org/develop.php). In this website, I also found information about what needs to be sent to the development group. They ask to generate, with the help of a mercurial functionality, a .diff file that contains the differences between the current source code and the one that I worked., (Barriers 8, row 55) I searched elsewhere and discovered a VIM FAQ here: http://vimhelp.appspot.com/vim_faq.txt.html. This site contains information about how to submit changes, and the site also says that in order to be able to send, you must first join the group. The information on how to join the group I found at: http://www.vim.org/maillist.php, I just needed to send an empty e-mail to vim-dev-subscribe@vim.org and wait for a confirmation.
, (Barriers 9, row 16) Following the guidelines of the link above, I observed two important items:
In http://www.vim.org/maillist.php#vim-dev there are separate mailing lists for branches of the project. For example: Lists for ads, development, questions, support, etc. In https://code.google.com/p/vim/issues/list there is a list with 97 items that seems to be about bugs. These bugs have an identification number, a summary, a status and a priority. My goal now is to identify and understand a bug that can be fixed by me."
Females learn in process-oriented learning styles,,,"(Barriers 5, row 24) 	More than a hour and a half and the compilation finally is over. The suggested command “make dev-install” is already deprecated, and it is recommended to compile with “make check”, and run the instdir/program/soffice. The software was executed without errors. The compilation and the execution are completed.

The remaining packages were successfully installed.
, (Barriers 4, row 18) I took a while, but I was able to configure the Git, I forked the JabRef repository and downloaded the code.  The tutorials available on Github really saved my life. Without being very sure about what I was doing, I was able to use the gradle to compile and execute the project. Success! Although I almost didn’t do anything, at least I felt a little better. , (Barriers 6, row 12) The next Wiki link is a video tutorial that shows a demonstration of how to build the LibreOffice. Actually, I’m very excited again! It seems that I’ll find some useful information about how to get the code, which is my goal at the moment., (Barriers 6, row 13) The video warns that the provided instructions are for Debian-based systems. I’m very excited again, because I’m using Debian.  Relevant video info in my opinion:
* The video says that it’s important to upgrade the system first;
* You must have Git installed;
* The video discusses the need to have all the LibreOffice dependencies installed;
, (Barriers 6, row 31) At this moment I’m feeling much more excited about what’s going on. I am happy because I fixed my problem, which was very simple to fix. I will never be discouraged, because the courage helped me fixing it., (Barriers 6, row 47) I executed the command: “make debugrun”. And now what should I do, wait?

, (Barriers 5, row 45) 	Build options are presented in the IDE (partial, module only and complete). I compiled the module through the IDE. Nothing had changed, nothing had to be rebuilt, so I successfully concluded, quickly.
, (Barriers 5, row 50) I executed the command, it took about 3 minutes and I got no errors. The last point in the tutorial is the use of Git by the IDE, to make pull requests, pushes and commits in the project. With the integration, automatically appeared the tests and application launch options. I ran the tests quickly, both local and global, and they were executed successfully.    
, (Barriers 5, row 69) So, I’ll go back to the Floss Coach to access the video tutorial, just because I don’t want to forget any configuration or command. I don’t need to install the dependencies again, so I’ll only see if there are updates to some component and I’ll start to clone the repository. It’ll probably take 4 hours. 
, (Barriers 5, row 86) I will reproduce the numerators error in the LibreOffice Write, to try to identify the actions involved in the whole process and to find terms that can facilitate the search through the corresponding codes., (Barriers 6, row 6) * I can see the commits flow on specific pages. Out of curiosity, I went into one of them and the last update was about three hours ago. In the other one, I was even more surprised: the last update was also three hour ago, but the flow of commits is much more constant. 
There is an “Easy Hacks” list that defines the first task to contribute. It’s cool! I’ll read the slides from this link:
https://people.gnome.org/~michael/data/2012-02-04-easy-hacks.pdf

I executed the second command: sudo apt-get phonon-backend-vlc. Everything worked! Now, I hope that the dependencies installation will work too., (Barriers 6, row 36) Build time! I open the tutorial in the “How to make the build” part. I’m a little apprehensive about this part, after what my classmates told me, this is the part that usually returns a lot of problems. I go to the folder where the code is saved. I execute the command to setup the build. I hope everything will work fine.

I made a sub list of bugs and improvements to try to implement, all extracted from the list
“:help todo”: <HELP TODO LIST HERE>. The time spent doing this sub list was 3 to 4 hours.
, (Barriers 8, row 40) My idea to fix the problem was to find out where in the code the error message (when a file cannot be unzipped) was displayed (“Error: Could not read uncompressed file”). Then put a flag that was activated when the error message was printed, and check that flag when the software writes the file., (Barriers 8, row 44) I searched the internet for this error and found these two sites:
