I don’t know exactly what to do and where to start, (Barriers 8, row 8) I chose this issue because it’s not a bug, it’s an improvement in the system, and it’s referring to an operating system that I use, and also because it’s a issue easy to understand. Choosing this issue took a while because there were some issues that were difficult to understand. I think I spent about 2 hours, sweeping the list and trying to understand them.

I’ll put it on my “list”. Just like the “Correct the texts that indicates Auto Correct [T] and [M] options”, which are with confusing names., (Barriers 5, row 74) The comments on the bug page, “Paste Special/Paste without formatting”, are not useful. A discussion began about how broad the options of this new feature should be: involving a lot of basic formats or just offering the formatting remover. Now I don’t know if I choose the error, because I dont know if implementing the formatting remover would be “acceptable”. , (Barriers 8, row 3) Problem: I’m not a VIM user, so I don’t know the software.

What can I do?
Solution: There is another list of bugs, by typing: “:help all” on VIM you get a very large list of bugs and improvements. 
, (Barriers 8, row 15) Since I was not successful in choosing from the list, I decided to look for a new list. I found information about this additional bug list on the VIM website (http://www.vim.org/develop.php). I decided to choose another bug from the list. The new bug is: An error message displayed is wrong. Instead of printing the error  'E163: There is only one file to edit', using the :next command with only one file open, the message printed is ‘empty buffer
, (Barriers 8, row 20) I chose this issue because it’s also about Windows. And because, besides being about an operating system that I use, it was easy to understand what was requested and it seems easy to implement. This issue will not take long to complete, which is important due to the project deadline, and I know that the issue needs to be accepted., (Barriers 8, row 36) Problem: Bugs in the “:help todo” list do not have a very large description, which makes it difficult to understand what needs to be done.

It was not just the “nationality” column that was not being exported to the patents, but also many others, including other types of data. Also it was not just in the .csv and .ods exportation cases that was giving a error: the .sxc format also had missing data.

I’ll create a restoration point before proceeding, to prevent future problems that can occur in the next installations. , (Barriers 6, row 9) I know that my reading is not in vain, but I will only be comfortable when I can download the code and be able to compile something. But I know that I can only do this by reading, because I don’t know how to do it now and I know that the information is necessary. I’m not feeling alone: LibreOffice really helps those who want to collaborate with them. I understand what the Wiki is providing to me in parts, because there are terms that are still a bit confusing for me., (Barriers 8, row 35) There is no much explanation of what the user meant by “could be clearer”. So, I discarded this item. I decided to go to item 4 of the sublist, but I was not able to reproduce the error.

Documentation General,"(Barriers 1, row 2) I looked in the gnome website (as the class monitor suggested) about the Empathy project, and I found (in the bugs section) a bug that seemed simple to me (for now).

The list of reported bugs that I’m looking for bugs is: https://code.google.com/p/vim/issues/list. They are sorted by time and priority, the priority does not help much because they all have medium priority. Some of the reported bugs are not so easy to understand. In most cases, the bugs depend heavily on the operating system, VIM version and plugins used. As I own a computer with two operating systems (Linux and Windows), the bugs that I choose to try to fix are bugs reported on these two operating systems., (Barriers 8, row 36) Problem: Bugs in the “:help todo” list do not have a very large description, which makes it difficult to understand what needs to be done. Solution: I noticed that in the first list I found (https://code.google.com/p/vim/issues/list), bugs were being registered at a reasonable frequency, a lot of bugs have been added to the list since I started working on the project, so I decided to go back to that list. And I realized there were new issues. I chose a issue that was added to the list on October 29th. <ISSUE DESCRIPTION HERE>

It was very complicated, because there are a lot of .C files and not all the files have comments in the beginning explaining what the file is, or a general idea about the contents of the file, or at least, what the file functions are used for.
, (Barriers 9, row 8) VIM was installed on Ubuntu, but I was not using the website information. As mentioned before, the page with installation descriptions is also bad. , (Barriers 9, row 12) As much as I read the site, I do not found access to the project, issues and development process. But only recently released versions.
, (Barriers 9, row 13) Some people are able to create scripts to test VIM features. I’m trying to find something I can do, because I don’t use VIM, so I have no idea about its problems. I did not find a list about it on the site.
, (Barriers 9, row 14) Since VIM is an open source project, there should be clear instructions about how people can contribute. If one of the menus were, for example, “Contributing with Implementation”, I would save time and courage. 
, (Barriers 9, row 22) Each of the 97 bugs in the list has a very short description, with very few words, this is bad because it is not possible to filter the bugs according to what can be easy, medium difficult or impossible to do. , (Barriers 9, row 32) Knowing that the contributions are made by diverse people, the instructions on the project website are inaccurate. Everything I could absorb of information from the site was provided with the help of the discipline monitor.
","(Barriers 2, row 1)  I joined the flosscoach.com website, and I read about the JabRef project, I followed the JabRef setup tutorial, installing the Java Development Kit, Gradle and Git. I followed the tutorial until the end. A problem occurred during the execution of the command “./gradlew generateSource”, and a message appeared., (Barriers 2, row 2) Anyway, I opened the code in the Eclipse, to have a notion about it. I tried to execute it as indicated in the tutorial but, naturally, an error occurred. I am following the task flow. 
, (Barriers 4, row 22) Now the challenge is to find out how the hell this project works… There are so many codes, classes… If at least a documentation about the code existed (not just about how to use the software), but I did not found enough information about it. I spent two hours snooping the exportation part, and so far I did not understood how it works...
, (Barriers 9, row 32) Knowing that the contributions are made by diverse people, the instructions on the project website are inaccurate. Everything I could absorb of information from the site was provided with the help of the discipline monitor.
","(Barriers 4, row 15) Due to the lack of experience, I didn’t know how to submit changes that I will do. The FAQ says “Please go to our GitHub page, fork our repo and pull your contribution”,  but I didn’t know how to create a fork or how to do a pull request (as I read in another page). I read the corresponding explanations in the GitHub and it now seems to make sense.
, (Barriers 5, row 81) The focus today is try to find the code related to the ordered lists creation, to identify and, if possible, fix the bug of the ordered lists that uses Roman numerals. I’ll search again on OpenGrok for keywords related to these lists. , (Barriers 8, row 6) Problem: Find a bug that I can fix.  The list of reported bugs that I’m looking for bugs is: https://code.google.com/p/vim/issues/list. They are sorted by time and priority, the priority does not help much because they all have medium priority. Some of the reported bugs are not so easy to understand. In most cases, the bugs depend heavily on the operating system, VIM version and plugins used. As I own a computer with two operating systems (Linux and Windows), the bugs that I choose to try to fix are bugs reported on these two operating systems., (Barriers 8, row 35) There is no much explanation of what the user meant by “could be clearer”. So, I discarded this item. I decided to go to item 4 of the sublist, but I was not able to reproduce the error. Time Spent: I spent about 3 hours to search the documentation, find the error message of item 6, and to try to reproduce the error of item 4.
, (Barriers 8, row 36) Problem: Bugs in the “:help todo” list do not have a very large description, which makes it difficult to understand what needs to be done. Solution: I noticed that in the first list I found (https://code.google.com/p/vim/issues/list), bugs were being registered at a reasonable frequency, a lot of bugs have been added to the list since I started working on the project, so I decided to go back to that list. And I realized there were new issues. I chose a issue that was added to the list on October 29th. <ISSUE DESCRIPTION HERE>
, (Barriers 9, row 10) OK. There’s a Community link, in this link there are mailing lists for certain issues to be discussed. I believe that it is necessary to register in the Community before attempting to make any contact. Is this the moment to get in touch? (Question to the class monitor)",

Changes merged, I’ll recompile the project. Apparently, the process is more faster than the first time. I really hope it is., (Barriers 5, row 87) It did not started as I expected. Two times that I opened the IDE I had to close it because it crashed and left the whole system slow. Reproducing the error did not give me ideas about how to improve the code search.

I checked if the Git version is the latest and I’ll try again.
50 minutes and 40% downloaded. I was lucky with the server used, because it took just 1 hour and a half and the download already ended (without errors). I’ll start compiling the project again (a process that, probably, will only be completed tomorrow)., (Barriers 5, row 75) To check the other bug, I need to compile it, because it seems, according to the comments, that in some versions the error no longer appeared with lists with Arabic numerals, only Roman numerals. I want to see how the lists without errors are being fixed, to see if I can apply it to the list sorted by Roman numerals. , (Barriers 5, row 77) Compilation restarted. Now the connection is working and the process started. I’ll not be able to browse the files and review the codes while it’s compiling, the system is very slow, it starts to crash too much.
, (Barriers 7, row 7) Today, after reinstalling the entire operating system (now using the latest version of Xubuntu), I reinstalled all the dependencies, and started the download of the source code. However, as people warned me, there is a long wait until the whole process is completed, I started 4 hours ago and at the moment the progress is still 51%., (Barriers 7, row 8) After a few hours, the process was finished, however, when I started the setup process, I couldn’t continue because there were dependencies that had not been installed. I installed the missing dependencies, and I resumed the compilation. During the process (around 4 AM) I realize that it is still far from over, so I leaved the notebook on, and went to sleep. ",

Definitely, it was so much easier to steer my code, although I think there still is a lack of documentation. 
, (Barriers 5, row 76) The biggest problem now is to find in the code the block related to the ordered lists. I searched at OpenGrok for related keywords, but I didn’t found useful results. When it’s time to compile, I’ll search again. If I do not find it at all, I’ll ask the community for help., (Barriers 5, row 84) I found some files related to the definition of the list patterns and the Writer module specifically, but I did not find any differences in the codes. For example, when using Arabic and Roman characters, which could justify the indentation problem in the paragraphs after the Roman numerator. The fact that several codes almost have no comments does not help much either., (Barriers 5, row 88) Something I had not thought about was consulting the help page about numbering styles, position, options. OK, it didn’t help me., (Barriers 5, row 89) I’ll create a query for “numbering type” and “formating”, not on the OpenGrok, but using the Terminal, with grep, in the Writer module. I didn’t found any useful reference that I’m looking for. The only ones that could have any relation are those the OpenGrok had already found. It’s very complicated to find something and “find myself” in these codes., (Barriers 7, row 11) Today is Monday, and I keep with the same LibreOffice compilation problem.

, (Barriers 5, row 66) I started the module compilation using the Make command. The same error appeared. I tried again to pull the project, this time, without the rebase option that is indicated in the wiki, and a notification told me that there are, yes, some updates from the remote repository. Changes merged, I’ll recompile the project. Apparently, the process is more faster than the first time. I really hope it is., (Barriers 5, row 87) It did not started as I expected. Two times that I opened the IDE I had to close it because it crashed and left the whole system slow. Reproducing the error did not give me ideas about how to improve the code search. I searched again for terms related to “numeration”, “numbering type”, “formatting”, “uppercase roman number”, “lowercase roman number”

",,,,"(Barriers 4, row 28) Now there is the .csv problem. I looked at the code for a few hours, but I can not understand how the export works without having a function of its own (as the other two types have). I think the problem might be somewhere where the columns being exported are added to the layout, but I don’t know how to test it and I do not understand where they come from. I was a bit sad because I could not solve the whole problem, but at least I fixed a part of it, and I did more than what was reported (the bug report didn’t describe nothing about the .sxc, or about the other columns besides “nationality”). Does it count?, (Barriers 6, row 17) I opened the video tutorial again to follow it. I do exactly what it asks me to do, because I don’t want anything to go wrong. I opened the Linux terminal and updated my system. OK, I’m afraid: Some pages were not found and some things could not be updated. Anyway, I insist. I upgrade (as requested by the tutorial). Again, there were things that could not be found., (Barriers 6, row 18) Now, the tutorial asks me to install the Git. I really hope to find it. I’m afraid because , since some things could not be fetched and updated, Git can not be found. I use the command to install Git. Well, my fears were fulfilled. Some links were offline and Git could not be downloaded and installed. Now, I’m going to look for alternatives to do that. , (Barriers 6, row 46) The website gave me a third command, which is used to open the LibreOffice. I’ll do it now (Monday, exactly 8:00 PM).

, (Barriers 7, row 13) Since I don’t know what to do, so I’ll try to start the whole process again. All the instructions I followed were taken from the LibreOffice website, from Wiki and from the available video tutorial on the page. I  downloaded the source code again, using: ‘# git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core’ (It was taken from the LibreOffice webpage), and the following error occurred: ‘fatal: destination path 'core' already exists and is not an empty directory’., (Barriers 9, row 32) Knowing that the contributions are made by diverse people, the instructions on the project website are inaccurate.

",,,"(Barriers 2, row 5) I thought about solving the #958 bug, titled as “ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException” in the easy bugs list available on the FlossCoach. The simplest way to solve it in my thought was to prevent the main window from being accessed as soon as the Setup selectors window was opened. For this, I searched on the internet a way to implement this, and I found this website:

What appeared to me is quite different from what appeared in the tutorial. But I'm moving on. And it seems to be compiling.  And in the present moment, I am only waiting for the compilation., (Barriers 6, row 41) I didn’t described on the last log, but I received an small error in my compilation. I don’t know if it’s an error or not, but the compilation didn’t worked. The command that the tutorial told me to execute was: “make && make dev-install && exit”. When I execute the command, Linux warns me that “There is no target for make dev-install”. People told me that this was not supposed to happen. When I get back home, I’ll try to run the autogen and compile it again. , (Barriers 6, row 46) The website gave me a third command, which is used to open the LibreOffice.

Following different tutorials, and copying registry values that already existed on my computer where the messages in the menu have icons, I could not found the exactly value. I tested all possible combinations of values in the records, and none made the icon appear in the menu. I spent most of the day 14/10 working on it, and a good part of the 15/10., (Barriers 8, row 23) The file containing this script is gvim.nsi. Analyzing the improvement, I was in doubt trying to find out if this issue could be used in my project, because:
         1) The user has already described how the NSIS script changes should be, so developing this improvement would only require following the steps the user describes and testing the result. So I do not know if I can use this issue in my work.
